Analyze the conversation: identify what was discussed, what decisions were made, what code was written or modified, and any important outcomes.\n3. Write a concise summary (3-6 bullet points) of the session.\n4. Determine today's date. Create the directory `.memsearch/memory/` if it doesn't exist.\n5. Append the summary to `.memsearch/memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (using today's date) formatted as:\n   ## Session HH:MM\n   - bullet point 1\n   - bullet point 2\n   ...\n6. After writing, run: memsearch index .memsearch/memory/\n   If memsearch is not found, try: uv run memsearch index .memsearch/memory/\n   If that also fails, skip indexing (the summary file is still saved).\n\nIMPORTANT: If the transcript is empty or cannot be read, do nothing.\n\n$ARGUMENTS",
